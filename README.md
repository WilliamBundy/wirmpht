# Wirmpht

Mostly just a header generator

## Usage

`wirmpht -p -s -t file.c > something.h`

- `-p` generates prototypes for functions.
- `-s` copies struct definitions.
- `-t` generates typedefs.

## Building

Run make.bat with Visual Studio installed. You may have to alter the path to vcvarsall.bat.

## History

This started as part of the Rituals project, but at some point I ripped it out and started tweaking it separately.
